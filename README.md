# GuardianEyesAI

GuardianEyesAI is a security robot project designed to enhance security and surveillance in our faculty. By leveraging computer vision, facial recognition, NLP and AI-powered interactions, we aim to provide an automated and intelligent alternative to traditional human security systems.



## Features
- **Night Detection:** Automated security monitoring during nighttime hours.
- **Facial Recognition:** Identify and interact with known individuals.
- **Voice Interaction:** Engage in conversations and answer questions about the faculty.
- **Live Streaming:** Real-time live streaming functionality for remote monitoring of the camera feed.
- **Object Detection:** Capable of identifying and classifying different objects using pre-trained deep learning models.
- **Facial Recognition Logging:** Logs recognized faces with timestamps, creating a history of detected individuals.
- **Voice Commands:** Voice command recognition for user interaction, allowing verbal commands and inquiries.


### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Usage

1. Run the night detection module:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

2. Run the facial recognition module:
    ```bash
    python Security Robot.py
    ```

3. Interact with the AI assistant:
    - Mention "sarah" to trigger voice commands.
